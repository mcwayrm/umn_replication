- Thank Derek Mikola and Moin Syed as hosts for the replication game


Pre-registration Details: 


Reproduction Notes: 
- Do the multi-researcher reproduction process like my past papers. 
- Add control means to Table 3 (main reproduction table)
- Table 3 and Figure 2 are the main reproductions
- README says some data is not publicly avaliable: CV data
- Good README. Seems to be using a template
- Need to time the replication code.
- Why standardize the secondary outcomes but not the primary outcome (publish)
- Note how the reproduction works. We don't have all the additional data we might want to explore further. 
- But that the effect sizes are massive. The data is clean. And remains a bit too good to be true. 





Coding Issues: 
- calculate_weights.R
	- base_path is determined on line 9, but this is cleared on line 16 with rm(list=ls()). This leads to a failure of line 38. Easy change would be to move line 16 above line 9. 
- In cleaning code, what is happening on line 126: 
clonevar importancefob = qualityfob 
clonevar importancesob = qualitysob 

- In the paper, they say these are p.p. changes. But I think they were standardized relative to control distribution. So I think these are actually SD changes. lin 192 in cleaning code 
local outcomes publish qualityfob qualitysob importancefob importancesob   

order `outcomes'

* Create z-scored variables
foreach var in `outcomes' {
	capture drop z_`var'
	qui summ `var' if low==0
	qui gen z_`var' = (`var' - r(mean)) / r(sd)
}

- Coding error in cleaning. Line 192. local is not standardizing values: 
local outcomes publish qualityfob qualitysob importancefob importancesob 


- Compare the sliding scale for publish against other qualtric slding scale measures. The bunching is suspicious. 
- Bunching around certain numbers

Robustness Checks: 
- Attempt addressing analytical decision making process. 
- Use multiversal analysis approach (permutations of all possible choices)
- This is similar to my education replication 
- Wild clustered bootstrapped errors. Check they are HC3 given effective cluster sample size is 40 -- so a small sample to determine the distribution.
	- Might need to do the HC3 (HC1, H2) in R. Stata seems to have an issue here. 
	= RYAN (DONE)
- Potentially changing the weighting scheme. 
- Table A.2 and A.3 and A.6
- Data seuthing = Emily
- Maybe do MHT corrections. Seems like a lot of regressions (could count them) for main outcome and secondary outcome with Null treatment and cross-randomizing treatments
	- (ALREADY DONE)
- Publish at research nodes in PA

- Could try ot bootstrap the beta coefficents and se -- this would check if estimates are senstive to sample composition. 
- Estimates are a LPM. Could try to estimate the effects with probit or logit...
	- Can't do this because continum 0 to 100. Not 0/1
- Re-run controling for duration/pagetime effects (some long tails)
- Re-run removing those who did not finish. 

- Look at balance on the author's sample selection. In main study cleaning, line 66. 
drop if missing(publish_meraid) & missing(publish_equsha) & missing(publish_salpov) & missing(publish_fememp) & missing(publish_finlit) 
- There are variables on characteristics. So can run a simple balance table on these characteristics. 
- Again looking at balance on the number of people who complete all 4 vigenettes. Line 75 
keep if count==4 

- Add a proposentiy score matching to see if the effects blow up. Construct a reasonable countrefactual on observables is the effect size reasonable 
- Want to  match treatment and control groups to get individual level effects. Then average the effect. Closer to synthetic control
