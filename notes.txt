UMN Replication Games: 
- Mar. 17th, 2025 at University of Minnesota
- Thank Derek Mikola and Moin Syed as hosts for the replication game


Pre-registration Details: 



Reproduction Notes: 
- Do the multi-researcher reproduction process like my past papers. 
- Add control means to Table 3 (main reproduction table)
- Table 3 and Figure 2 are the main reproductions
- README says some data is not publicly avaliable: CV data
- Good README. Seems to be using a template

Coding Issues: 
- calculate_weights.R
	- base_path is determined on line 9, but this is cleared on line 16 with rm(list=ls()). This leads to a failure of line 38. Easy change would be to move line 16 above line 9. 


Robustness Checks: 
- Attempt addressing analytical decision making process. 
- Use multiversal analysis approach (permutations of all possible choices)
- This is similar to my education replication 
- Wild clustered bootstrapped errors. Check they are HC3 given effective cluster sample size is 40 -- so a small sample to determine the distribution.
	- Might need to do the HC3 (HC1, H2) in R. Stata seems to have an issue here. 
	= RYAN
- Potentially changing the weighting scheme. 
- Table A.2 and A.3 and A.6
- Data seuthing = Emily
- Maybe do MHT corrections. Seems like a lot of regressions (could count them) for main outcome and secondary outcome with Null treatment and cross-randomizing treatments
